## Problem 10

## Research on Question
After I read the question I noticed that I will have to be able to create a square function. So I looked up ways of creating a sqaure function and found a few ways to do it. The easiest way I could find to create a squared function in racket was to do the following - `(define (sqre s)(* s s))`. What this is doing is defining a function 's' that will then multiple itself by itself, creating a squared function. I found this information though this stack overflow [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/26515457/9343831e).
