## Racket Overview
- Racket is a general-purpose programming language as well as the worldâ€™s first ecosystem for developing and deploying new languages.[1]
- One of its design goals is to serve as a platform for language creation, design, and implementation. The language is used in a variety of contexts such as scripting, general-purpose programming, computer science education, and research.[2]
### Syntax
- Always start your files with #lang racket to define the language. The syntax is uniform and made of s-expressions. An s-expression is an atom or a sequence of atoms separated by spaces and enclosed in parenthesis. Square brackets [] and braces {} can be used instead of parenthesis (as long as they match per type). There are a few syntactic shortcuts such as e.g. ' , # . [3]
