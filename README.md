## Racket Overview
- Racket is a general-purpose programming language as well as the worldâ€™s first ecosystem for developing and deploying new languages.[1]
- One of its design goals is to serve as a platform for language creation, design, and implementation. The language is used in a variety of contexts such as scripting, general-purpose programming, computer science education, and research.[2]
### Syntax
- Always start your files with #lang racket to define the language. The syntax is uniform and made of s-expressions. An s-expression is an atom or a sequence of atoms separated by spaces and enclosed in parenthesis. Square brackets [] and braces {} can be used instead of parenthesis (as long as they match per type). There are a few syntactic shortcuts such as e.g. ' , # . [3]

## Download & Install DrRacket

* To run the files in this repository you will have to download DrRacket. Below is a link to DrRacket, download and install it by following the instructions on the website.

* Link : https://download.racket-lang.org/ [4]

## How to run files in this repository

> Make sure you place racket in your path on your machine to be able to run racket files.

#### DrRacket

1. Make sure you have downloaded and installed DrRacket.
1. Clone repository to your machine by using the following command - git clone https://github.com/DonalMcGahon/theory-of-algorithms-assignments
1. Open the file you would like into DrRacket and run the file by pressing Ctrl & R.

> OR

#### Visual Studio Code

For the development of most of these problems I used Visual Studio Code.

> Download Link - https://code.visualstudio.com/download

1. Download and install Visual Studio Code on your machine.
1. Use for example - racket Problem.rkt on the integrated terminal to run the racket file.
1. Or you can follow the following tutorial given by my lecturer [Ian McLoughlin](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin) on how to run racket files with the shortcut Ctrl-Alt-B. Here is the [tutorial](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/a2c20148-deb3-48a5-be55-5f96421ee441). You can find the JSON file in this repository in the folder vcode.


## Lecturer
 This repository is for problem sheets that are given to me for the module Theory of Algorithms by lecture [Ian McLoughlin](https://ianmcloughlin.github.io/). The course module sample files can be located [here](https://github.com/theory-of-algorithms/example-scheme).
