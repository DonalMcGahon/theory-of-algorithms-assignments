## Research on Question
I done some reseach on this question by searching and understanding what the [hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) is. I learned that the Hamming distance between two strings of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different. [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) In other words, it measures the smallest amount of numbers it takes to change one string into the other.
