# **Problem Sheet Question 2**

## Problem 2
Write, from scratch, a function in Racket that takes a positive integer n0 as input and returns a list by recursively applying the following operation, starting with the input number.

End the recursion when (or if) the number becomes 1. Call the function collatz-list.
So, collatz-list should return a list whose first element is n0, the second element
is n1, and so on.
