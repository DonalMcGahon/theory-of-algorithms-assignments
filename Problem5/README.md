## Research on Question
For this problem we were asked to create a program that will count the number of non zero elements in a list. I first researched ways of how to do this in racket and found multple ways to do this, but not from scratch. So I decided to try and interpret the solutions I found and make them work from scratch.
I also researched what hamming weight was and how it works. The Hamming weight of a string is the number of symbols that are different from the zero-symbol of the alphabet used. [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)
So in my case I tested my solution with the amount of 1's there was in a list that consisted of 0's and 1's.
